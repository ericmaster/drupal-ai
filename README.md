A production-tested AI toolkit for Drupal 11 development — currently aligned with Drupal 11.4.7 and compatible with Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot.

This repository serves a dual purpose:

1. **Active Drupal 11.4 project** — the AI configuration is actively used on a real Drupal 11 / DDEV / Acquia Cloud project.
2. **Reusable contribution** — the `.claude/` folder is project-agnostic and can be dropped into any Drupal project.

### Agents (`.claude/agents/`)

Specialized subagents Claude can delegate to for focused work.

| Agent | Role |
|---|---|
| `code-reviewer` | Bug detection, security issues, quality review |
| `done-gate` | Runtime validator — builds, tests, `ddev drush cr` |

### Commands (`.claude/commands/`)

Slash commands for common workflows.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/code-review` | Full review of a branch, PR, or Jira ticket — PHPCS, PHPStan, best practices |
| `/config-export` | Export Drupal configuration with proper workflow |
| `/create-pr` | Create a PR targeting the base branch with standard title format |
| `/drush-check` | Common Drush checks to verify site health |
| `/performance-check` | Analyze site performance and caching configuration |
| `/ready-pr-in-review` | Move a PR from Draft to Ready for Review, assign reviewer |
| `/review-pr` | Review a GitHub PR end to end |
| `/security-audit` | Audit the site for security issues and vulnerabilities |

### Rules (`.claude/rules/`)

Always-loaded context files that shape AI behavior in this project.

| Rule | What it enforces |
|---|---|
| `docblocks.md` | Drupal-style docblocks, `@param`/`@return`/`@throws` conventions |
| `drupal.md` | Prefer DI, follow module conventions, use Drupal patterns |
| `frontend.md` | SDC components, Twig escaping, `libraries.yml`, Storybook-first |
| `php.md` | `final` classes, `private` properties, `readonly` DI, immutability |
| `phpcs.md` | `phpcs.xml` as source of truth, flag violations during review |
| `testing.md` | Choosing and locating Unit, Kernel, Functional, and DTT tests |
| `tooling.md` | All commands run inside DDEV |
| `workflow.md` | Branch naming, commit message format, PR target branch |

### Hooks (`/hooks`)

Shell scripts triggered automatically by AI tool events (Claude Code hooks).

- `session-start.sh` — runs on startup and resume; checks DDEV status, git branch, and site health
- `session-resume.sh` — runs after `/clear` or `/compact`; re-establishes context

> **Note:** Both hooks detect the repository's default branch from `origin/HEAD` and support `docroot/`, `web/`, and `html/` web roots. Set `DRUPAL_WEB_ROOT` or `DRUPAL_THEME_ROOT` when a project uses a different layout. They do not start Docker or DDEV automatically.

## Setup for a New Project

### 1. Copy the `.claude/` folder

```bash
cp -a /path/to/this-repo/.claude /path/to/your-project/.claude
```

### 2. Generate your `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`

`CLAUDE.example.md` (Claude Code) and `AGENTS.example.md` (Codex) are production-grade references. They are examples, not project facts. Rather than copying their placeholder values, paste this prompt into your AI tool:

```
Read `CLAUDE.example.md` and help me create my own `CLAUDE.md` for a new Drupal project.
Ask me one section at a time about: DDEV project name, module prefix, theme name,
custom modules, hosting platform, base branch, and CI/CD setup.
```

### 3. Set up team mappings (GitHub + Jira users)

If your project uses GitHub PRs and Jira, the PR commands (`/create-pr`, `/review-pr`, `/ready-pr-in-review`) rely on a GitHub username → Jira name/email mapping. Without it, reviewer assignment and Jira sync won't work.

```bash
cp .claude/data/mappings.example.json .claude/data/mappings.json
```

Edit `mappings.json` and add your team's entries.

### 4. Adjust `settings.json`

Review `.claude/settings.json` and update the `permissions` block to match your toolchain. The defaults assume DDEV + GitHub CLI. If you use Acquia CLI, copy `settings.local.example.json` to `settings.local.json` and add the `acli` entries. Do not commit local settings or team mappings.

### 5. Adjust workflow rules

Edit `.claude/rules/workflow.md` to match your branch naming, commit format, and PR conventions.

## Project-Specific Files (gitignored)

These files are gitignored because they contain project-specific or sensitive data. Create them from the provided examples:

| Gitignored file | Create from |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | `CLAUDE.example.md` or the project's own agent guide |
| `AGENTS.md` | `AGENTS.example.md` or the project's own agent guide |
| `.claude/data/mappings.json` | `.claude/data/mappings.example.json` |
| `.claude/settings.local.json` | `.claude/settings.local.example.json` |

## About This Project

This configuration is battle-tested on a production Drupal 11 platform powering 150+ sites, running on DDEV locally and deployed to Acquia Cloud via GitHub Actions.

Stack: Drupal 11.4 / PHP 8.3 / MySQL 8.0 / DDEV / Acquia Cloud / Storybook 9 + ViteJS 6.

The `.claude/` folder is intentionally decoupled from the Drupal codebase so it can be maintained and contributed independently. Codex users can symlink `.claude/skills` into `.codex/skills` — see [`.codex/README.md`](.codex/README.md).

# Review PR

Prepare a GitHub Pull Request locally, analyze it using project rules, optionally post a GitHub review comment, and optionally synchronize the related Jira ticket.

## Purpose

Use this command when the user provides a PR URL or number and wants to:
- prepare PR locally
- review code using project standards
- generate a review summary
- optionally post a GitHub comment
- optionally update Jira based on review outcome

## Input

- GitHub PR URL or number  
  If missing → ask for it.

## Assumptions

- Inside correct repo
- Uses GitHub (`gh`)
- Uses DDEV + Drupal
- Uses Jira via `acli`
- Mappings at `.claude/data/mappings.json`

---

## Workflow

### 1. Validate GitHub access

Run:
```bash
gh auth status
```

If fails:
```bash
gh auth switch --user <account>
```

---

### 2. Resolve PR details

Run:
```bash
gh pr view <number-or-url> --json headRefName,title,files,author,body
```

Show:
- title
- branch
- changed files

---

### 3. Detect Jira ticket

Search in:
- PR title
- body
- branch

Example: `PRJ-703`

If none found:
- continue without Jira

---

### 4. Ensure DDEV running

Run:
```bash
ddev describe || ddev start
```

---

### 5. Checkout branch

Run:
```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout -b <branch_name> origin/<branch_name>
```

If exists:
```bash
git checkout <branch_name>
git pull origin <branch_name>
```

If blocked → ask to stash.

---

### 6. Prepare environment

Run:
```bash
ddev composer install
ddev drush cim -y
ddev drush updb -y
ddev drush cr
```

Stop on failure.

---

### 7. Generate login link

Run:
```bash
ULI=$(ddev drush uli) && echo "$ULI" && open "$ULI"
```

---

### 8. Run PHPCS on changed files

From the changed files list gathered in step 2, filter to PHP files that fall within PHPCS scope:
- `docroot/modules/custom/`
- `docroot/themes/custom/`
- `docroot/sites/default/settings.php`

For each matching file, run:
```bash
ddev phpcs <file-path>
```

Collect all output. If no PHP files are in scope, skip this step silently.

Store the raw PHPCS output — it will be used directly in the Analysis Phase.

---

### 9. Run PHPStan

```bash
ddev phpstan
```

Collect output. Store raw results — use them as-is in the Analysis Phase.

---

# Analysis Phase

Analyze only changed files.

## PHPCS
Use the actual output from step 8. Do not guess or infer PHPCS issues — report only what the tool output.
If PHPCS produced no errors or warnings, state "PHPCS: clean" and move on.
If PHPCS was skipped (no in-scope PHP files), state "PHPCS: no in-scope files".

## PHPStan
Use the actual output from step 9. Do not guess or infer issues — report only what the tool output.
If PHPStan produced no errors, state "PHPStan: clean" and move on.

## PHP Design
- prefer final when appropriate
- no public properties
- private by default
- clean structure

## DocBlocks
- missing docblocks
- missing `@var` when needed
- clear `@param` / `@return`
- examples when helpful

## Drupal
- DI over `\Drupal::`
- correct module placement
- naming conventions

---

# Review Output

## Confirm posting + Jira outcome (single ask)

After building the review, display the draft GitHub comment text to the user:

> Here is the GitHub comment I'll post — feel free to edit it before confirming:
>
> ---
> [draft GitHub comment]
> ---
>
> What would you like to do?
> 1. Post as-is (no Jira update)
> 2. Edit comment, then post (no Jira update)
> 3. Post + partial approval in Jira — quick note (no summary)
> 4. Post + partial approval in Jira — with review summary
> 5. Post + final approval in Jira — quick note (no summary)
> 6. Post + final approval in Jira — with review summary
> 7. Post + request changes in Jira
> 8. Skip everything
> 9. Post my own comment on GitHub PR
> 10. Approve PR on GitHub + add my own comment

If user picks option 2 → ask: "What should the comment say?" then use their version.
If user picks option 9 → ask: "What would you like your comment to say?" then post it as a plain GitHub comment.
If user picks option 10 → ask: "What would you like your comment to say?" then post a formal GitHub review approval with that message using `gh pr review --approve --body "<message>"`.

Map the answer:
- Option 1 → post GitHub comment as-is, skip Jira
- Option 2 → post edited GitHub comment, skip Jira
- Option 3 → post GitHub comment, run Jira partial approval flow (quick)
- Option 4 → post GitHub comment, run Jira partial approval flow (with summary)
- Option 5 → post GitHub comment, run Jira final approval flow (quick)
- Option 6 → post GitHub comment, run Jira final approval flow (with summary)
- Option 7 → post GitHub comment, run Jira changes-requested flow
- Option 8 → do nothing
- Option 9 → prompt user for free-form message, post as GitHub comment only, skip Jira
- Option 10 → prompt user for free-form message, post as formal GitHub review approval (`gh pr review --approve --body "<message>"`), skip Jira

If no Jira ticket was detected → options 3–7 collapse into option 1 automatically (no Jira steps).
Options 9 and 10 are always available regardless of Jira ticket detection.

---

# Jira Synchronization

If no Jira ticket → skip entirely, no ask.

---

## Jira auth check

Run:
```bash
acli jira auth status
```

If fails → skip all Jira steps silently, do not ask the user to log in.
To fix auth outside this command: `acli jira auth login`

---

## Load mappings

Run:
```bash
cat .claude/data/mappings.json
```

---

## If outcome = partial approval

Add a Jira comment only — no status change, no reassignment.

Resolve the PR author's full name from mappings (key = PR author's GitHub username).

**Quick note (option 3):**

```text
Good job <author-full-name>! I've approved <PR link>.

Still needs one more approval before we can merge.
```

**With summary (option 4):**

```text
Good job <author-full-name>! I've approved <PR link>.

Still needs one more approval before we can merge. Here's a quick summary of what I found:

<bullet points from review summary>
```

---

## If outcome = changes requested

If mapping exists:

```bash
acli jira workitem assign --key <ticket> --assignee "<mapped>"
acli jira workitem transition --key <ticket> --status "In Progress"
acli jira workitem comment create --key <ticket> --body "<comment>"
```

Resolve the PR author's full name from mappings.

Comment body:

```text
Hey <author-full-name>, left some feedback on <PR link> — just a few things to look at before we can merge.

<bullet points from review summary>

You've got this!
```

If mapping missing:
- keep assignee
- still move status

---

## If outcome = approved

If mapping exists, assign the PR author from mappings.

```bash
acli jira workitem assign --key <ticket> --assignee "<mapped>"
acli jira workitem comment create --key <ticket> --body "<comment>"
```

(No status change)

Resolve the PR author's full name from mappings.

**Quick note (option 5):**

```text
Good job <author-full-name>! I've approved <PR link>. Ready to merge when you wish.
```

**With summary (option 6):**

```text
Good job <author-full-name>! I've approved <PR link>.

Here's a quick summary of what I found:

<bullet points from review summary>

Ready to merge when you wish.
```

If mapping missing:
- keep assignee
